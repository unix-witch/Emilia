# Emilia
Emilia is a complete re-write of Sarah, focused on less bugs and a cleaner
look for the main page. Emilia still retains the original goal of Sarah,
to fit in a 1.5in floppy disk, and is still written in pure PHP.

The software uses the 14th revision of the pink-ink license


Emilia has working random messages now! Edit them in ./configs/site.php  
Adding boards is the same as always, edit the array in ./configs/boards.php  
Preventing certain files from showing up, (php, json, sql) is also the same!  
Its not recommended to edit it, however you can if you want
